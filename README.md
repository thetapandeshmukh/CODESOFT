# CODESOFT C++ Programming Tasks 

This repository contains four C++ tasks to be submitted to CODSOFT. Below are the details of each task:

## Task 1: Guess the Number

Create a C++ program that generates a random number and asks the user to guess it. Provide feedback on whether the guess is too high or too low until the user guesses the correct number.

## Task 2: Simple Calculator

Develop a calculator program that performs basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. Allow the user to input two numbers and choose an operation to perform.

## Task 4: To-Do List Manager

Build a simple console-based to-do list manager that allows users to add, view, and delete tasks. The features include allowing users to input tasks they want to add, implementing a function to add tasks to the list, displaying the list of tasks with their status (completed or pending), allowing users to mark tasks as completed, and providing an option
